GuestTek management reorganization announcement generator. 

Yes, it's a joke.... or is it? Maybe it's secretly running from a cronjob on an HR server?

Requires Python 3.6 (if you remove the f-string from the Balloon Doggies quote it'll run on Python 2 and earlier Python 3 versions).
It requires Faker (P2: pip install faker or P3: pip3 install faker).
